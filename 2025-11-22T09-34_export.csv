Looks wise exceptional, keyboard is not that small like people mention it. You can also use it for long hours as battery is efficient. And i compared the sound of my laptop to asus tuf and Lenovo loq and to my suprise this has more sound as it comes with six speakers. I'm truly happy to own zenbook. Gaming wise average, I mean if you're truly interested in games go for other varients as this is a work laptop.

Thought it was a defect, but it’s actually because of Windows Fast Startup.To fix it, go to:Control Panel → Power Options → Choose what the power buttons do → Change settings → Uncheck “Turn on fast startup” → Save.After this, the laptop shuts down completely and the light turns off normally.Fast Startup just makes boot a bit faster, so disabling it is totally safe.Great laptop overall — smooth performance once this setting was adjusted! 👍

Read more | Laptop looks stylish and looks premium however only time will tell how the built quality is. Serves my work related purpose. Performace is good as the clock speed of processor is 3 Ghz (not 4.1 which is maximum extent of clocking purformance of the processor.Pro:-1. Looks premium ( hp logo is cheery on top)2. Keyboard quality is good and all necessary keys are present on keyboard (no need of pressing fn for some important keys like home, pageup and page down etc.3. Speaker quality is very good compared to lenovo, asus or dell in this price range. Loud and clear.4. Two usb type A 3.0 and one usb type C 3.0 (might be 3.2 I am not sure)5. Pre-installed OS and office with lifetime validity6. Browsing speed is also very goodCon:-1. Visibility of alphabets and numbers becomes very bad in low light condition (might not be a con for experienced typist). Keys are not even like somwhere its ok and somwhere its bumpy or not aligned properly. But typing will not get affected.2. Screen quality is very down grade. Other laptops like Asus are providing Oled display in this price range. Brightness is very low. My old lenovo Ideapad has better brightness and clearity of screen than this laptop (which I bought for Rs. 25K before 5 years)3. For those who wants to extend the screen for uptop 2 monitors, the given USB C port doesnt support video output so you can only connect one monitor at a time.4. No option to expand SSD storage as it only supports 512 Gb (which is already included) and no extra SSD slot or even HDD slot.Can't say:1. Performace will get tested after heavy usage so will update later2. Not faced heating issue which will only get tested after heavy usageEdit:1) Battery last for 6 to 7 hours while using only excel or any other basic work2) Good news for GTA 5 lovers as it can run but on low settings. You won't get graphics but game runs smoothly.3) Has heating issues even after running excel and tally prime

Read more | Good Laptop — but Warranty Issue Created by Amazon(Clicktech retail) , Not HP (Read if You're Facing the Same Problem)I purchased this HP laptop on 28th September 2025, mainly because it had everything I needed specially a backlit keyboard as mentioned in the catalogue — and yes, it indeed has one.💻 Product ReviewModel Number - 15-fd0572TU (backlit fs)The laptop looks really good and feels premium, especially considering it’s a budget-friendly HP. Build quality is neat, the design is sleek, and since it’s HP, reliability is something you can count on.Performance-wise, it’s smooth for everyday use — browsing, office work, entertainment — all run without any hiccups.If you’re getting this laptop for around ₹33K–₹34K, it’s a solid deal.Cons:Display: Could’ve been a little better, but still acceptable for normal use.Keyboard: Just okay - not bad, not great.Main Issue – Warranty Confusion: This part was not HP’s fault but Amazon’s.⚠️ Warranty Issue (and How I Solved It)When I checked the HP Support site, my warranty was showing as starting from 25th March 2025, which was six months before I actually bought the laptop. Apparently, that’s the date the seller imported it from China - and this happens often with HP laptops sold by third-party sellers.So effectively, I was left with only about 8 months of warranty instead of 1 year.I contacted HP support, and they asked for the purchase invoice to update the warranty.Here’s where Amazon messed up, the invoice they provided didn’t have the serial number or product ID printed on it. Without that, HP can’t verify your purchase date or extend the warranty.After this, I spent weeks calling both HP and Amazon - endless waiting, repeated explanations, lots of assurances but no actual solution.Finally, after persistence, I managed to get it fixed :- here’s how 👇✅ What You Should Do If You’re Facing the Same Problem1. Always ask to speak to a senior or escalation team — both on HP and Amazon sides. Regular customer service agents usually can’t resolve this.2. Don’t waste time repeatedly explaining your issue to first-level representatives — escalate right away.3. Ask Amazon to reissue your invoice with the serial number (though in my case, they refused).4. Request Amazon’s senior escalation desk to send you an official email (from an Amazon domain) confirming your name, serial number, order details, and purchase date.5. Share that official email with HP support, and request them to manually update your warranty period.6. Keep following up patiently — it takes effort, but HP can fix it if you provide all the required proof.💬 Final ThoughtsOverall, I have no complaints about the laptop itself — it’s a good, reliable machine with solid features for the price range.But the warranty issue is something you should be aware of before buying. The fault lies with Amazon for not printing the serial number on the invoice, which creates unnecessary frustration for customers.Once you get past that, it’s a great purchase.In short:✔️ Great budget HP laptop with backlit keyboard⚠️ Check warranty immediately after purchase🚫 Amazon should fix their invoicing system

I bought this laptop in September 23rd Amazon Prime day sell. I have purchased this laptop for general purpose and mostly coding practices. As im a working professional and wanted to upgrade my skills in (full stack development) upgrading to Lenovo is a good experience as of now its been 2 months im using it. Good display and keyboard quality it is having backlit feature which can be adjusted in 2 ways. As processor is i7 (Smartchoice Ideapad Slim 3 13Th Gen Intel Core I7-13620H) battery consumption is more as it requires more power to deliver things smoothly. I didnt found any heating issue as off now as i tried gaming also it works smoothly no lag faced as such. It is a very easy to carry laptop students who are in college they will find this useful. For display i can say they have used panels which are good not at higher side i can say may be because this is performance and battery delivery mixed kind of laptop if they would have used high quality of display then that can cause more battery consumption hence to balance this they came up with good quality display.Sound quality i can say it is good. I have attached video in my review. We get thin metal body and I specially liked the position of lenovo icon in the back side. I know it’s lengthy review but trust me if this is your first laptop or if you are switching from any other this is good one. One more addition you can extend the ram pf this laptop even if you feel like this ram is not helping in future you might can extend it

I've been using it just for school work for a month. Ssd and 16gb ram helps but there are some lags here and there even with basic excel and one or two background work/educational apps. Zero gaming capability.Battery runs for 2hrs so bad.Charging takes 30min-1hr.Sound quality is mediocre.Display is fine.Quality of keypad touchpad hinges are also fine.Weight is good to carry in a bag.

Read more | I recently purchased the Dell G15 5520 Gaming Laptop, and I must say, it is an absolute powerhouse. Equipped with an Intel i5-12500H processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD, this laptop delivers an ultimate gaming experience. The NVIDIA RTX 3050 (4GB GDDR6) graphics card ensures smooth and immersive gameplay, making every session a visual treat.The 15.6"" FHD WVA AG 120Hz display with 250 nits of brightness provides superb screen quality, perfect for both gaming and multimedia consumption. The vibrant colors and sharp details enhance the overall visual experience. The backlit keyboard with an orange hue adds a stylish touch, making it a pleasure to use even in low-light conditions.Despite its many strengths, the laptop does have one notable drawback—the battery life. Given its substantial weight and heavy-duty battery, I expected it to last at least three hours on a single charge. However, I was disappointed to find that the battery life only allows for about half an hour of gaming. This short battery life can be a significant inconvenience, especially for gamers who enjoy long sessions without being tethered to a power outlet.Aside from the battery issue, my experience with the Dell G15 5520 has been excellent. The laptop's performance, screen quality, and overall build make it a fantastic choice for gamers and power users alike. The combination of Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 2021 adds to its appeal, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.In summary:Performance: Top-notch gaming performance with Intel i5-12500H, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and NVIDIA RTX 3050.Display: Superb screen quality with a 15.6"" FHD WVA AG 120Hz display.Design: Stylish backlit keyboard and robust build quality.Battery Life: Short battery life, only around 30 minutes of gaming on a single charge.Overall Experience: Despite the battery issue, an excellent gaming laptop.Overall, the Dell G15 5520 Gaming Laptop offers a great experience, provided you're prepared to deal with its limited battery life. If you're primarily using it in a stationary setup, this laptop will undoubtedly serve you well.
